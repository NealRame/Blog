			<h1>Passionate developer</h1>
			<p>
				I am developer and enthusiast for technologies of information,
				particularly web applications and internet of things.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've been working as a developper since 2005. My areas of
				expertise are C++ and Javascript.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think I'm good at:
				<ul>
					<li>developping applications in C/C++ or Javascript,</li>
					<li>build and test this using jenkins,</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				I work hard to become almost as good at putting it all into
				production using Docker containers and cloud technologies.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am very interested by functional programming techniques and
				software architecture.

			<h1>When I do not code</h1>

				When I do not code, I really enjoy climbing, play and take long
				walks with my dog. I also like taking pictures of my trips and
				rambles.
