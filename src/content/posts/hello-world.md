resume: This is a the first article of my very first blog! So welcome!
title: Hello world !
---
Like I said in the [about](/#about) section, I am a passionate developer. I
build applications using **C/C++**, **Javascript**, **CSS** and **HTML**. So
expect to see articles about these topics on this blog.

I am also very interested in climbing, street workout, crossfit, photography,
music and dogs, so I could also write articles on these topics.

I am not a native english speaker, but I chose to write that blog in english to
learn to write/speak in good english. So if you find errors or if you have
suggestions on how I should write something, please let me know.

See you soon!
